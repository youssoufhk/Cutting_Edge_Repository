# Cutting_Edge_Repository

M2IF 2020 

The goal of our project is to detect anomalies using BiGAN.

In order to find the best architecture of the networks, run the code #BiGAN_TF_Recherche_stable.py

Once the model is found, use the architecture in the code #BiGAN_TF_Detection.py

Run it and you'll have all the tools to detect the anomalies presented.
